# PyScan

**üêç PyScan** is a simple port scanner tool designed to test open services on an IP address. It allows you to scan a single port or a range of ports and get information about the services using them. The motivation behind creating PyScan was to gain a deeper understanding of network scanning tools like Nmap and how they work.

## Features
